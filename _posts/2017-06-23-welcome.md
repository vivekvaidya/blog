**Welcome**

Hello! Thanks for visiting my blog. I've always wanted to share some of my thoughts with the world, and I figured starting a blog would accomplish that. This, just like most other things in life, is an **experiment** - and there will be mistakes - but I will persist through. The intention here is to learn and grow, yes, but to also have a positive impact on **you**, the reader.

Feel free to bookmark this page (<https://vivekvaidya.me/blog>) and visit when you like. I intend on getting started with an article about freshman year of college, also my first year away from home - and the lessons that I've learned thus far.

Thank you!
